    Events are a pure function of the samples table, so a schema upgrade
    from an older events-table shape recreates the events table and lets
    the service rebuild it from the raw samples instead of migrating
    derived rows. The stored schema_version only advances once that
    rebuild commits (see WaterQualityService.reconcile_settings), so
    interrupting the upgrade at any point replays the whole migration on
    the next start.

    event_changes is an append-only log of recomputation results, not a
    cache that can be rebuilt from samples: consumers may still be
    trailing any water mark, so it is created with IF NOT EXISTS and is
    never dropped or rebuilt, even across schema upgrades.

    event_acks holds manual acknowledgements keyed by event_id and is
    likewise user state that cannot be rebuilt from samples. It is
    created with IF NOT EXISTS and only ever loses individual rows as
    part of a device's recomputation transaction when the acknowledged
    event changes or disappears (see
    WaterQualityService._invalidate_acknowledgements).
